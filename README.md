# CineChoice- Movie-Recommendation-System-based-on-Reinforcement-Learning 
**Recommender Systems** Recommender Systems are designed to suggest items to users based on various factors. These systems predict the products or content users are most likely to engage with, enhancing their experience by providing relevant recommendations. They not only speed up searches but also introduce users to options they might not have discovered on their own.

In this project, we explore the application of Reinforcement Learning techniques to address the challenge of Movie Recommendation. Specifically, we have implemented:

A **Multi-Armed Bandit**-based recommender system.
An **Actor-Critic**-based recommendation framework using **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.
